<p><b>Mitch</b> is an unofficial mobile client for <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io</a>, the indie game storefront. The app allows you to install Android games from the store and keep them updated. Thus, this can act as an alternative to the Google Play Store for indie game developers and enthusiasts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download games from itch.io and keep them updated</li>
<li>Support for APK downloads as well as HTML5 games</li>
<li>itch.io account is not required</li>
<li>Blocks trackers and analytics by default (F-Droid version only)</li>
<li>Beautiful Material UI adapts to custom color schemes set by game developers</li>
<li>Full functionality of itch.io's mobile website</li>
</ul>

<p>The app is still in development, some features are planned but not yet implemented.</p>

<p><b>Planned features:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Dark theme for app (currently there's a white theme, if you set your itch.io account to use the dark theme the app will look odd)</li>
<li>Some extra features for owners of the famous Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</li>
<li>Improvements to UI and stability</li>
</ul>
